# Pilot Showcase

This is an example app showcasing my ability to create a stylish (alright, passable) Single Page Application using some new modern vanilla JS technologies. This makes use of modules and JSDoc comments. 

The app displays data relavant to a pilot who is choosing an airport to land at. Not knowing the domain all that well, I took some liberties in choosing which information is the most important. 

The color scheme is blue and red pastels for that simple yet cheery look. I followed minimalist stylization for the UI design, though there is room for improvement in a few places!

In most aspects, this repository follows best practices; however, I did omit any SEO. To pull off the fancy SPA behavior I took a shortcut utilizing innerHTML which for security reasons isn't something you should do when displaying any user-controllable data due to XSS vulnerabilities.
